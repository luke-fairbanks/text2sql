Question: What is the total revenue (including tips) generated by each server?
#### Generated SQL
```sql
SELECT staff_id, 
       SUM(amount + tip) AS total_revenue
FROM restaurant_order
JOIN payment ON restaurant_order.order_id = payment.order_id
WHERE staff_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY staff_id;
```
#### Response:
Hey there! I've got the total revenue (including tips) generated by each server. Here's the breakdown:

- Server S003 brought in a total of $36.25.
- Server S001 raked in a total of $63.00.

Looks like both servers have been doing a great job! If you have any more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!

It did Ok on this one and performed the correct join and performed the correct math, but it returned server ID's when someone would probably want their names, and there was some confusion in the response on staff roles, as S003 is a host not a server.

# Picture of Schema

# Description of Database
This database models the "all-in-one" system for running a restaurant. It tracks the whole experience: from someone booking a table to paying for their order. It also handles the staff side of things, like who's working when and which server is handling which orders, and the tips made from them. It would allow a restaurant manager to be able to query any information from menu items, to staffing schedules and payments using our text-2-sql tool.
